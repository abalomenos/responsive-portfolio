                    <img class="profile" src="./assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="AGB photo 404">Well, the first thing you should know about me is that I hate About Me pages! There is much more to say with “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet”! LOL
                    <br><br>
                    But since this is an About Me page, here are a few things.
                    <br><br>
                    I love to travel and go on adventures! I have lived half my life in the States and the other half in Greece. In the States, I lived in New York for 4 years, which was an amazing experience! Now that I am in California, I must say – I am not leaving anytime soon, you can’t beat this weather here!
                    <br><br>
                    Recently I discovered a new passion and that is Motorcycle riding! I know you will say it is dangerous, risky, that I am crazy, blah, blah, blah – I’ve heard it many times. Yes, it is more dangerous than driving, however commuting is easier and much more fun! While riding any anxiety or stress you have will go away and the thrill is unlike any other! I could go on and on for the pros of riding, but the most important reason is because of Freedom – I can’t think of a better word in describing the sense of self-sufficiency and independence that comes from the simple act of getting on a bike and twisting the throttle.
                    <br><br>
                    One last thing to conclude! My ideal day at work would be writing code on my laptop while sunbathing at the beach and drinking a Pina Colada!!!
                    <br><br>
                    Cheers!!!
